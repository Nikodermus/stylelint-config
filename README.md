## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

### CLI Installation  <a name="installation--cli"></a>
Required to have installed Node 8+ and NPM 5+ and StyleLint as a global package. Run in the command line:

```sh
npm install -g stylelint
npm install --save-dev stylelint-config-cuemby
```

Afterwards you can check errors and warnings with:

`stylelint path/to/file.scss` or `npm run stylelint`

### Text Editors Installation  <a name="installation--text-editors"></a>

There're many plugins available that allows you to have live linting while working on a project and can throw errors, warnings and auto-corrections on the go. It requires you to have  installed the CLI version. Some are listed here:

* [VSCode StyleLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shinnn.stylelint)
* [Sublime Linter (StyleLint)](https://github.com/kungfusheep/SublimeLinter-contrib-stylelint)

* [Vim Ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale)

## Usage  <a name="usage"></a>

### Project Usage <a name="usage--project"></a>
Add to your  `.stylelintrc` file on the root of the project.

```javascript
{
  "extends": "stylelint-config-cuemby"
}
```

### Global Usage <a name="usage--global"></a>
In case you want to follow this ruleset for all of the projects in your machine or don't want to set up a `.stylelintrc` file for each project, you can create a root machine file, and StyleLint will throw errors based on such a file when it doesn't find one in your project.

In any bash or unix based CLI:
```sh
npm install -g stylelint-config-cuemby stylelint-scss
touch ~/.stylelintrc
echo '{"extends": "stylelint-config-cuemby"}' >> ~/.stylelintrc
```

## StyleLint Approved Code  <a name="eslint-approved"></a>

### Git Hook  <a name="eslint-approved--git-hook"></a>
Only allow eslint-compliant code into the commits, this ensures only great-quality code to be present in the repository.

1. Get inside the `.git` folder for the project
2. Go to `hooks/` and rename `commit-msg.sample` to `commit-msg`
3. Inside `commit-msg`, add the following code

```sh
#!/bin/bash
stylefiles=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep '\.s?css\?$')

# Prevent StyleLint help message if no files matched
if [[ $stylefiles = "" ]] ; then
  exit 0
fi

stylefailed=0
for file in ${stylefiles}; do
  git show :$file | stylelint $file
  if [[ $? != 0 ]] ; then
    stylefailed=1
  fi
done;

if [[ $stylefailed != 0 ]] ; then
  echo "StyleLint failed, improve your code to commit!"
  exit $stylefailed
fi
```
4. Try to committing a file with StyleLint errors, you should receive a message and being unable to commit.

   You can also run "npm run stylelint-commit" locally or "stylelint-config-cuemby commit" globally to test the Git Hook.

### Disable StyleLint <a name="eslint-approved--disable"></a>

If for some given reason, you need to disable ESLint for a code snippet, you can do it this way wrapping the desired code, but allowing to be parsed all across the document:
```scss
/* stylelint-disable */
@includes placeHolder(){
  color: $gray;
}
/* stylelint-enable */
```

If for some given reason, you need to disable StyleLint for file, you can do it only by ignoring the whole file via a `.stylelintignore` file which uses the `.gitignore` syntax.

In case you need to commit not stylelint-compliant code for a strong reason, disable only what you need and add a comment explaining why the StyleLint was disabled or that instance is not indicated to have it prevent you from committing your code.

```sh
# Disabling it because it's production code
dev/*.css
```
